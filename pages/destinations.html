                <p>Tanzania is a country truly blessed: peaceful, vibrant history and culture, excellent national parks and miles of white sandy beaches. The vastness and its’ remoteness, makes the Southern Circuit superb for game viewing, river boat and walking safaris. Exploring the Southern Circuit, a vast, primeval and raw wilderness untouched by mass tourism is truly a walk on the wild side.</p>

                <p>Tanzania’s only protected coastal wildlife preserve was gazetted in 1964. It covers an area of some 250 sq km from the Wami River in the south to the Mligaji River in the north, with the Moshi railway line as the western boundary. Saadani is located in what is historically a very important coastal strip emerging as an important trading post, appearing on maps from the early 19th century. The village also contains a ruined fort, built by Arab slavers in the last century. This fort later became a German Boma (administrative centre) after 1888.</p>
                <h6>Gombe National Park</h6>
                <p>Gombe is the smallest of Tanzania’s national parks: a fragile strip of chimpanzee habitat straddling the steep slopes and river valleys that hem in the sandy northern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Its chimpanzees, habituated to human visitors, was made famous by Jane Goodall.</p>
                <h6>Selous Game Reserve</h6>

                <h6>Udzungwa National Park</h6>
                <p>Part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, is a series of mountains ranging from Taita Hills in Southern Kenya to the Makambako Gap in southern central of Tanzania. Covering an area of 1900 sq km, the park’s uniqueness lies in its biodiversity, hosting a variety of animals and plant species not found anywhere else in the world. The red colubus and the Sanje crested manabrey, elephants and leopards are some of the residents in this park. A good range of birdlife is also present which includes Rufous winged sunbird, Iringa akalat, Lagden’s bush shrike and Udzungwa partridge.</p>
                <h6>Katavi National Park</h6>
                <p>Is the most unspoilt and least visited park in Tanzania. The buffalo herds here are regarded to be the biggest in the country. Other animals include zebra, antelope, leopard, crocodile, elephant, lion and hippo. The park is noted for its Miombo Woodland, vast floodplains and pal fringed Lake Chala and Katuma River. Bird life is particularly rich around Lake Chala.</p>
                <h4>MALAWI - The Warm Heart Of Africa</h4>
            <p>Malawi is fondly referred to as the warm heart of Africa. The true essence of Africa is seen here. Traditional villages and life style still prevail in this part of Africa. Malawi is one of the very few African countries that has not yet experienced the over capacity of tourism thus making it more appealing to the traveller who prefers the off beaten track routes. Being part of the Rift Valley, the scenery in Malawi is stunning, beautiful and dramatic!</p>
            <h6>Lake Malawi</h6>
            <p>Africa’s third largest lake is rich with a variety of tropical fish and up to 500 unique indigenous species of cichlids (a perch like freshwater fish). The lake covers one-fifth of Malawi with half of the south-eastern section of the lake belonging to Mozambique with the border running through the centre of the water. Tanzania lies along the north-eastern shore. Lake Malawi bears many qualities of a sea except salty water and for much of the year it is placid and welcoming, whilst at other times strong winds and storms can produce surfable waves. The greatest attractions are the golden palm fringed beaches, irresistible to holidaymakers. A part of this lake has been declared a World Heritage Site.</p>
             <h6>Liwonde National Park</h6>
             <p>Malawi’s finest park, boasts one of the largest concentration of hippos and crocodiles in Africa, a resident and migratory population of well over 300 species. Antelope, waterbuck, impala and bushbuck graze on the flood-plains whilst herds of elephant drink, and bath in the river. The highlight of a visit to Liwonde are the river boat safaris.</p>
             <h6>Nyika National Park</h6>
             <p>In the far north of Malawi, at an altitude of around 2,500 m the Nyika National Park protects over 3,000 sq km of this rich plateau, noted for the endemic herbs and heathers found in its rolling, montane grasslands. The wild, open nature of the plateau attracts visitors who come to view the birds and animals, study the flowers, walk or ride across the hills and valleys, or simply sit in the sun and absorb the magnificent scenery. Large herds of roan, reedbuck, zebra and eland gather here, together with leopard, serval and spotted hyena.</p>

                    <h4>The Coast and the Islands</h4>
                    <h6>Dar es salaam</h6>
                    <p>“The Haven of Peace” in Arabic, Dar es Salaam, has one of the best deep natural harbours in the world. From a small Swahili town in the middle of the 19th century, it has grown into a large modern African city with a population of over 3 million dwellers representing over 120 ethnic tribes of different cultural backgrounds. Modern Dar es Salaam boasts of banks, international shopping malls, exciting night-life, foreign embassies, and international hotels and restaurants.</p>
                    <h6>Zanzibar</h6>
                    <p>The richness of its cultural heritage and the lure of the exotic spices and beaches make Zanzibar one of the most sought after holiday destinations. The main attraction of Zanzibar is Stone Town with its winding alleys, white washed old buildings, bustling bazaars, mosques, exotic architecture and influences of different cultures. Stone Town derives its name from the fact that it was the first stone town in Zanzibar and probably in East Africa.</p>
                    <h6>Mafia</h6>
                    <p>The Mafia Islands have escaped the mass tourism status that is associated with other famous coastal towns on the Indian Ocean due to lack of good beaches. However, this is compensated for by the rich and colourful fishes and coral, some of the finest in the Indian Ocean, thus making Mafia a diving Mecca in Tanzania. Mafia Marine Reserve, the largest in East Africa, covers over 800 sq km around the Island and Chole Bay and is one of the best diving sites. The Marine life varies from small tropical fishes to Barracuda, Flying fish,  Red mullet and Parrotfish.</p>
                    <h6>Pemba</h6>
                    <p>Pemba is mysterious, magical and enigmatic with beautiful landscape and beaches. Remote and receiving very few travellers it offers spectacular diving locations, characterised by clear blue waters. Pemba is also famous for traditional bull fighting, witchcraft and cloves.</p>
                    <h6>Kilwa</h6>
                    <p>The wealthy island city of Kilwa was the most important of trade centres that flourished the East African coast from the 1100s to the early 1500s. Kilwa Kivinje was a major 19th century slave-trading centre. Roughly 20,000 slaves were exported annually from there during the 1860’s and was also Germans’ southern administrative headquarters. Kilwa Kisiwani is famous for its ruins, Islamic architecture and small fishing villages, unchanged by the progress of the rest of the country.</p>
                    <h6>Mikindani</h6>
                    <p>Mikindani Bay is a large, well protected harbour and deepest in Tanzania. Off this busy harbor lies a circular lagoon on which sits the historic port of Mikindani. It is a fascinating old town with winding streets and an exciting blend of African, Arabic and European architecture. Mikindani was an important export point for trade from Malawi, Zambia, Angola and Zaire. The German colonial authorities had a Boma (administrative centre) and residential buildings constructed around Mikindani, which includes the old fort, the Governor’s House and a commemorative “Slave Market”.</p>

                    <h4>The Highlands</h4>
                    <h6>Mufindi Highlands</h6>
                    <p>Mufindi is set at approximately 6000 ft and has a mosquito free cool climate, a welcome respite from the raw heat of the bush. Located within the African Rift Valley among the highland tea estates, Mufindi is around 130 km from Iringa. The lakes are stocked with rainbow trout so the fly-fishing is excellent. Time here is meant to be spent absorbing the beautiful surroundings, however activities such as walking, bird watching, fishing, horse riding, mountain biking, swimming, ‘culture tours’ around the village (witch doctor, local ways of life) and informative tea talks are available.</p>
                    <h6>Mbeya</h6>
                    <p>Mbeya with an altitude of 1,700 m is the capital of southern Tanzania and an incredibly friendly town. Formed in the 1950s during the gold rush, it is the country’s most agricultural region producing coffee, tea, bananas and a variety of other cash crops. There are plenty of walking opportunities in the area including the two climbable mountains of Mbeya and Loleza Peaks, which dominate the Mbeya skyline. Another interesting excursion is to the Mbozi Meteorite, weighing in at 25 tonnes and the fourth largest in the world. Ngozi Crater Lake is a sight of outstanding natural beauty and a superb hiking location, a green shimmering lake walled by the collapsed caldera of the extinct Ngoni Volcano. The peak of Ngoni is 2,620 m and is the highest point of the Poroto Ridge Forest Reserve.</p>
                    <h4>Northern Mozambique - The Jewel of Africa</h4>
                    <p>The greatest asset of Mozambique is its people, un-spoilt beaches and the beautiful countryside. In spite of the many years of war, the Mozambican people are very hospitable and friendly. It is not unusual to be invited to sit and talk to the chief or asked to share a meal with a local family. The ethnic diversity of the Mozambican people is a very varied one: Africans, Arabs, Europeans and Mestigoes who are a mix of African and European heritage. This mixed cultural heritage is evident in the religion, music, dance and food of the daily Mozambican life.</p>
                    <h6>Nissa National Park</h6>
                    <p>It is the largest conservation area in Mozambique and it contains by far the greatest concentration of wildlife in the country in particular, huge herds of elephants and plenty of big cats. The reserve also has over 9,000 of the sable antelope and several thousands each of Cape buffalo, lichtenstein hartebeest, elend and zebra. There are smaller populations of kudu, bushbuck, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, reedbuck, and hippo. Duiker and warthogs abound. Lion, leopard and spotted hyena are common. The birdlife is rich with some rare species including the rare Angola pitta and Pell’s fishing owl.</p>
                    <h6>Pemba</h6>
                    <p>The coastal town of Pemba lays claim to some of the finest coral reefs in all of southern Africa. Brilliantly coloured coral is but a short swim from the white sands of Wimbe Beach. Divers and snorkellers swim among a myriad of exotic fish in crystal clear water. Naturally, the profusion of seafood makes time spent here a gourmet’s delight. The beaches are wide, sandy and clean, and lined with palm trees. A coral reef protects the beach and guarantees safe swimming as well as good snorkelling.</p>
                    <h6>Ibo Island</h6>
                    <p>This is where modern Mozambique derived its name. An important Portuguese trading post in 1754, it served as the main clearing house for slaves, ivory, trading and shipping post to merchants and traders from Europe, Arabia, India, China and Indonesia. Like most of the Mozambican coastal towns, the mixed influence of different ethic groups is evident in the architecture, religion, customs, social practices, language, dress, dance, cuisine,  and music. Ilha de Mozambique, a World Heritage Site is definitely one of the historical destinations in this part of Africa.</p>
